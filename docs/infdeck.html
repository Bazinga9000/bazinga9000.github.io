            <p><strong>The Infinite Deck</strong> is a deck of cards I made back in 2019 for Tabletop Simulator consisting of 180 distinct suits and an extension of the standard card ranks, going from zero to twenty, the court cards, the ace, and then an ∞ card of each suit.</p>
<p>The deck can be found on the Steam Workshop page <span class="hyperlink"><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1817166181">here</a></span>.</p>
<p>At some point in between then and now, it broke, and once I was reminded of this project’s existence, I fixed it again. Just in case some future thing breaks it again and you have some burning desire to use this deck in TTS or elsewhere, I have uploaded the cards and card back images to this site, which can be downloaded by clicking <span class="hyperlink"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/162Qu4BWpeCi9XNLlXnkTHvGEsuJsDtPy/view?usp=sharing">here</a></span>.</p>
