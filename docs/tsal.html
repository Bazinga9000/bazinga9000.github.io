<p>Tsal, written in the native orthography as <tsal>Cal</tsal>, is an extremely overloaded word that may refer to both a worldbuilding project that I’ve had simmering in my head since at least 2019, or the conlang spoken therein (or the people that speak it, or their nation…). I might eventually document the worldbuilding more on this site, since it is very fun and involves an interstellar multispecies civilization of immortal wizards with far-future technology and a magic system derived from an unholy amalgam of linguistics, programming, and axiomatic mathematics (which would come as no surprise to those familiar with me or my background), but this particular series of posts will focus on documenting the language, as that is one of the most developed parts of the world.</p>
<p>Since I have recently constructed a font (which is my first time both making a font and dealing with vector graphics in general, so please forgive any typographical warts), so I can finally start documenting things more formally. The work of a conlanger is never done, so things explained here might change later, and thus this explainer will change with it. However, I will try to put only the things that I expect to be stable on this website to minimize this.</p>
<p>If you don’t have much prior background in linguistics, this reference will aim to explain everything you need to understand the language. If you <em>do</em> have much prior bakcground in linguistics: Tsal is a synthetic language featuring free word order (with VSO as a pragmatically neutral default word order), fluid-S active-stative alignment, and heavy use of converbs.</p>
