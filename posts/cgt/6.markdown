Let's look at a pretty little Hackenbush flower:

What is the value of this flower? Lazuli can win by chopping the blue petal, and either of Ruby's first moves leaves Lazuli with a single green branch, so this position is positive. How positive is it? Well, you may have heard this one before:

It's smaller than $1$. And $\frac{1}{2}$. And $\frac{1}{4}$. And *every* positive fraction. Just like $\star$! However, there is one crucial difference between this position and $\star$: This one is positive! It's positive, but infinitely tiny! We have encountered an infinitesimal! We shall call this new value $\up$, pronounced "up", and its negative shall be $\down$.

"Now hold on!", I hear a subset of the audience cry, "$\up$? $\down$? We already have a term for infinitesimals, the ever-reliable $\varepsilon$! Why aren't you using that?"

Don't worry, subset of the audience, combinatorial game theorists haven't decided to use a new name just because. The reason why we can't use $\varepsilon$ is because that name is already taken! $\varepsilon$ *does* exist, and we will encounter it in a later part. As it turns out, $\varepsilon$ is *quite a bit bigger* than $\up$ (though still infinitesimal). But we're getting ahead of ourselves.

Alright, what's $\up$ in our vertical bar notation? It differs from previous Hackenbush positions in that a simplest representation doesn't just fall out from the position. We'll have to coax it into a nicer form ourselves. First, let's just write the entire game tree out in vertical bar notation:

$$ \up = \game{0, \star, \game{0, \star}{0}}{\star, \game{0, \star}{0}}$$

This is a *bit* uglier than we're used to. In fact, it would be a tremendously useful exercise to simplify this position yourself, by deleting dominated options and bypassing reversible moves, but I will go through it here.

First, we can remove dominated options. Let's compare $\game{0, \star}{0}$ and $\star$ to see if one is strictly greater than the other. $\game{0, \star}{0}$ corresponds to the Hackenbush position consisting of the stem and the petal of Figure 5.1, and $\star$ is that extra green leaf. This means that the position $\game{0, \star}{0} - \star$, which is actually just $\game{0, \star}{0} + \star$ is in fact equal to $\up$! So, we know it's positive, meaning that $\game{0, \star}{0} > \star$. This lets us remove $\star$ from Lazuli's side and $\game{0, \star}{0}$ from Ruby's. We've reduced the position to

$$ \up = \game{0, \game{0, \star}{0}}{\star}

Now, are there any reversible moves? Since we know $\up$ is positive, Lazuli's move to $\game{0, \star}{0}$ is reversible (Ruby can go to $0$, better for them than $\up$), so we can replace it with all Lazuli's options in $0$. Lazuli has no options in $0$, so we can simply delete it. This gives us the simplest form of $\up$, namely:

$$ \up = \game{0}{\star} $$

Much better. This lets us quickly get a simplest form for $\down$ too, which is

$$ \down = \game{\star}{0} $$
