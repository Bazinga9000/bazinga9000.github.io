Let's look at a pretty little Hackenbush flower:

What is the value of this flower? Lazuli can win by chopping the blue petal, and either of Ruby's first moves leaves Lazuli with a single green branch, so this position is positive. How positive is it? Well, you may have heard this one before:

It's smaller than $1$. And $\frac{1}{2}$. And $\frac{1}{4}$. And *every* positive fraction. Just like $\star$! However, there is one crucial difference between this position and $\star$: This one is positive! It's positive, but infinitely tiny! We have encountered an infinitesimal! We shall call this new value $\up$, pronounced "up", and its negative shall be $\down$.

Formally, we will call a value $x$ **infinitesimal** if, for all positive dyadic fractions $d$, $-d < x < d$.

"Now hold on!", I hear a subset of the audience cry, "$\up$? $\down$? We already have a term for infinitesimals, the ever-reliable $\varepsilon$! Why aren't you using that?"

Don't worry, subset of the audience, combinatorial game theorists haven't decided to use a new name just because. The reason why we can't use $\varepsilon$ is because that name is already taken! $\varepsilon$ *does* exist, and we will encounter it in a later part. As it turns out, $\varepsilon$ is *quite a bit bigger* than $\up$ (though still infinitesimal). But we're getting ahead of ourselves.

Alright, what's $\up$ in our vertical bar notation? It differs from previous Hackenbush positions in that a simplest representation doesn't just fall out from the position. We'll have to coax it into a nicer form ourselves. First, let's just write the entire game tree out in vertical bar notation:

$$ \up = \game{0, \star, \game{0, \star}{0}}{\star, \game{0, \star}{0}}$$

This is a *bit* uglier than we're used to. In fact, it would be a tremendously useful exercise to simplify this position yourself, by deleting dominated options and bypassing reversible moves, but I will go through it here.

First, we can remove dominated options. Let's compare $\game{0, \star}{0}$ and $\star$ to see if one is strictly greater than the other. $\game{0, \star}{0}$ corresponds to the Hackenbush position consisting of the stem and the petal of Figure 5.1, and $\star$ is that extra green leaf. This means that the position $\game{0, \star}{0} - \star$, which is actually just $\game{0, \star}{0} + \star$ is in fact equal to $\up$! So, we know it's positive, meaning that $\game{0, \star}{0} > \star$. This lets us remove $\star$ from Lazuli's side and $\game{0, \star}{0}$ from Ruby's. We've reduced the position to

$$ \up = \game{0, \game{0, \star}{0}}{\star} $$

Now, are there any reversible moves? Since we know $\up$ is positive, Lazuli's move to $\game{0, \star}{0}$ is reversible (Ruby can go to $0$, better for them than $\up$), so we can replace it with all Lazuli's options in $0$. Lazuli has no options in $0$, so we can simply delete it. This gives us the simplest form of $\up$, namely:

$$ \up = \game{0}{\star} $$

Much better. This lets us quickly get a simplest form for $\down$ too, which is

$$ \down = \game{\star}{0} $$

Note that we notate $\up + \up = \doubleup$ ("double-up"), and $\down + \down = \doubledown$ ("double-down"), and any higher multiples are notated $n.\up$ or $n.\down$. 

Naturally, since $\up$ is positive, we have

$$ \up < \doubleup < 3.\up < 4.\up < \cdots $$

but how do these values compare with other things we've seen, like $\ast$ or for that matter $1$?

Though comparing multiples of $\up$ with $1$ is easy, we'll do $\ast$ first. Let's first consider $\up - \star$, which is the same as $\up + \star$, which is *also* the same as the following Hackenbush position:

        Figure 6.2: A position with value $\up + \star$.
    </figcaption>
</center></figure>

Whoever moves first here wins, since they can cut the stem of the flower, leaving their opponent with a zero position. This means that $\up$ is confused with $\star$. Does this hold for every multiple of up? No!

Consider $\up + \up + \star$. Ruby only has two distinct moves here: One to $\up + \up + 0$ and another to $\up + \star + \star = \up$. Both of these moves are positive, so Lazuli will always win here, no matter who goes first (Lazuli going first can simply move to $\up + \up$ and win).

What about comparison to $1$? To compare multiples of $\up$ with $1$, we will perform massive overkill and show a theorem that tells us about a lot more than $\up$ and a lot more than $1$. 

Recall from Part 5 when we learned of *impartial* positions, those where each player has the same set of moves at every point. $\up$ is not impartial, but it *does* satisfy a slightly weaker property. At every subsequent position (other than zeroes), both players have *some* move, though not necessarily the *same* move. Positions with this property are called **dicotic**. Note that adding two dicotic positions together makes another one. 

I now present the equivalent for the Sprague-Grundy Theorem for dicotic games. It doesn't tell us about the exact possible values of dicotic positions, but it is still very powerful:

**The Lawnmower Theorem:** Every dicotic position is infinitesimal.

-----------

**Proof:**

By Induction.

*Base Case*: $0$ is infinitesimal.

*Inductive Case*: Suppose $G = \game{G^L}{G^R}$ is dicotic. This means that all $G^L$ and all $G^R$ are dicotic, so assume them to be infintesimal.

Consider the position $x - G$, where $x > 0$ is some positive number in canonical form (that is, there are no dominated or reversible options). We wish to show that Lazuli wins no matter who goes first.

Let us first consider if Ruby goes first. Ruby's moves in this position are to either $x^R - G$ or to $x - G^L$. If Ruby moves to $x^R - G$, $x^R$ is a positive number and so by the other branch of this inductive step (when Lazuli is to move), Lazuli wins. If Ruby moves $x - G^L$, Lazuli wins by induction.

Now consider the case when Lazuli goes first. Since $G$ is dicotic, it must have an option $G^R$. Lazuli can therefore move to $x - G^R$ which by induction is a win for Lazuli.

$\blacksquare$

A brief aside to explain the whimsical name "Lawnmower Theorem": If you consider a Hackenbush position $G$ where the only branches that connect directly to the ground are green, then that $G$ must necessarily be dicotic (since either player will always have at least one of those green branches to chop). Lazuli's winning strategy in $x - G$, where $x$ is some positive dyadic fraction, is to employ a "lawnmower" to cut all the aforementioned green branches in $G$. After this is complete, $G$ is gone and Lazuli will always have a move in the positive $x$, so they can win.
